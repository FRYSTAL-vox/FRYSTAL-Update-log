# FRYSTAL-Update-log
Material update log for Minecraft
First of all, I wish you a good time.

FRYSTAL texture package is a Minecraft texture project made by FISH, XHcreeper. 

We are committed to creating a texture package that upgrades the experience. You can join our QQ group chat or get the free beta version we provide on mediafire. But if you want to experience the official version, you need to pay us one dollar.

If you send this document to others without our permission, we will pursue your legal responsibility. You should give them this link.
